# Stock Price Movement Analysis

## Problem Statement
Stock price movement is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors such as economic conditions, company performance, market trends, and investor sentiment. Investors and traders rely on historical price data and technical indicators to make informed decisions. However, manually analyzing stock trends is time-consuming and prone to errors.

This project aims to develop a data-driven approach to analyze stock price movement using historical data. By leveraging statistical techniques and visualization methods, we can identify trends, detect significant price fluctuations, and analyze trading volume patterns. The goal is to provide investors with better insights into market behavior and help them make informed investment decisions.

## Key Objectives
- **Trend Analysis:** Identify patterns in stock prices using moving averages.
- **Price Insights:** Extract the highest and lowest prices to assess stock performance.
- **Volume Analysis:** Study trading volume variations to understand market activity.
- **Visualization:** Plot stock price trends and volume data for better decision-making.

## Scope of the Project
- **Data Collection:** The analysis is based on historical stock market data.
- **Technical Analysis:** Using simple moving averages (SMA) to identify price trends.
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib is used to create graphical representations of price movements.
- **Future Enhancements:** The model can be extended by integrating machine learning techniques for predictive analysis.

## Expected Outcomes
- A clear understanding of stock price movements over a given time period.
- Insights into how market trends influence price changes.
- A foundation for AI-based predictive modeling in financial analysis.

This project serves as a stepping stone for advanced financial analysis and AI-driven stock market predictions.
